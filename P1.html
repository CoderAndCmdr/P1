	<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
	
	<p>I have a bachelor's in mechanical engineering and am hoping to branch into programming and/or mechatronics. I am very interested in the parallels between programming and mechanical design.</p>
    
    <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
    
    <p>I would like to improve my web development skills so that I can build any idea I have. I am also using it for my software engineering certification.</p>
    
    <h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
    
    <p>I have designed a couple websites. I am not an expert in CSS, so hopefully I will get some good practice in this class</p>
    
    <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
    
    <p>I have taken CS50 and CS51, as well as some programming classes for my mechanical engineering degree. I also enjoy playing programming style computer games such as SpaceChem.</p>
    
    <h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
    
    <p>I have worked on a couple websites in PHP for CS50. </p>
    
    <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
    
    <p>I am working on a Windows laptop. Essentially a PC.</p>
    
    <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
    
    <p>Not particularly...other than I hope to become a more able web and app developer in the coming weeks</p>
